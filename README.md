# Quiz App for CS Students - API

In my last year of college, we were required to pass an exam (quiz) in order to be able to present our final project. I made a full stack app to help me and my colleagues prepare for this exam. This is the backend API needed for the app to run. The client can be found [here](https://github.com/crististoica/quiz-app-remaster-client)
